# loca2

TODO:

- color coding
- conform polylines after map.. (functionality of mapbox?)
- time runs out for a question.

- switch overpass endpoint if problem.
- more restrictive tag-filtration

- index db?
- exercise-construction performance (load/insert/update/delete in chunks/trnsactions)
- toString() reflection
- trust bad overpass.certificates

- Predefined exercise-areas, progress sharing
- Change theme/ map-theme
- Exercise persistance through app-uninstalls


KNOWN BUGS:
- Loading exercise service runns, activity killed. Start activity and stop service: not working
 (service reads exit-flag in previous instance).
- Exercise activity briefly started before follow-up quiz if tapping the screen during text So...
- Sometimes false-positives in line-segment-crossing-detection during exercise creation.
