KNOWN BUGS:
- Loading exercise service runns, activity killed. Start activity and stop service: not working
 (service reads exit-flag in previous instance).
(fixed?) - Exercise activity briefly started before follow-up quiz if tapping the screen during text So...
(fixed?) - Sometimes false-positives in line-segment-crossing-detection during exercise creation.
